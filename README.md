# Overview

ft_containers is a reimplementation of key components of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), a project from the École 42 curriculum.
The project replicates the behavior and interface of standard containers such as `vector`, `map`, and `stack`, along with supporting utilities like `pair`, `enable_if`, and custom iterators.  

All functionality is implemented from scratch using C++98, emphasizing template programming, allocator usage, and iterator design.  
Through this project, developers gain a deeper understanding of STL internals, template metaprogramming, and container performance characteristics.
